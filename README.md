# Budget Ball
#### I tried to think of a better name, but this one stuck
A quick and visual way to budget resources. Monthly budgets, group holiday expenses, &c.

Click on the numbers to edit the amount, click on the titles to edit the title. The intial pool of money is in a call that is initially called "Main", which will always be there. You cannot allocate more money that this initial total to any of the other balls. However, you can always add more to the Main ball.

Click the Plus in the upper right corner to add a new ball. This could be a monthly expense, perhaps, or maybe someone that is contributing to the holiday. This will add a new ball with a starting amount of $100, and will subtract $100 form the main pool. Enter an amount of $0 to remove a ball.

All changes are saved to local storage. 

In this screenshot, Bob, Alice, Fred and Janice are figure out who can pay what for their upcoming camping trip. They've almost got the whole thing covered, but someone still needs to get the last $273.
